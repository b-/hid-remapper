# Xiao_female_USB

This branch exists to serve as a repository for a simple PCB that provides a USB host connector for the Seeeduino Xiao RP2040. It's mainly intended for [jfedor/hid-remapper](https://github.com/jfedor2/hid-remapper), and I expect this to be a pretty niche item, hence this project not having its own repository.

The entire bill of materials for the PCB is as follows:

1x Seeeduino Xiao RP2040
1x Amphenol 87583-compatible USB connector

And that's it. Regarding the 87583 connector, this is a pretty standard USB-A female part. Pretty much any USB connector that looks right and isn't USB 3.0 should fit.

Note: to be absolutely clear, this PCB is just a wire. Really. Don't expect anything special.
